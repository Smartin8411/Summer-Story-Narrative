<h1>Summer Story Narrative</h1>
<h3><small>By Martin Onyimba</small></h3>
<p><strong>During the summer, I played this game called NV2 on this website called thewayoftheninja.org/nv2.html that was made by the company Metanet Software and this game is 
 basically a 2D platform game where you can sign up and make levels and play levels for a score. So far since April 17 2018, I have made and published 663 levels but though some of my
 and playable for players to play while some of my other levels are difficult that either I'm the only one that plays it, no one plays it, few players play it or all players beat it 
 that fill up the leaderboard. Also you can play levels that players have made and levels that metanet has made.</strong></p>
